            <p>My name is Mark Howe. I am an owner / operator of a custom cabinet manufacturing facility located in North Georgia. Throughout the years I have honed my skills as a business owner facing the daily challenges of entrepreneurship. Even though I have enjoyed the opportunity to serve others through my business I find myself in search of something more. I have come to the conclusion that although I create beautiful furniture grade cabinets for my customers I would not be able not change the world for the better with the skills utilized in custom cabinet fabrication.
            </p>
            <p>Understanding that technology is the driving force that ensures the modern world turns I made the decision to embark on a new journey and pursue a career in the field of computer programming. After researching a plethora of options for education I found a program offered at Georgia Tech which was the best fit and has amazing results for its students. I enrolled immediately to ensure that I secured a placement in the poplar coarse and now I am happy to say that it is one of the better choices that I have made in my professional career.       
            </p>
            <p>I live in the city of Cartersville, Georgia, which is where is graduated from Cartersville High School. I have a wonderful wife and 4 children, and I hope to teach my children what I learn as a developer so that they may be prepared for their future paths in life.
